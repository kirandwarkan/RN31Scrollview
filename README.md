# RN31Scrollview
This example project was created to quickly reproduce an issue observed with React Native's
scrollview on Android. (React Native 0.31)
The screenshot folder shows the issue observed. When a refresh is used on the scrollview,
iOS correctly clears the first red view to display the blue view. Android does not clear
the red view.
